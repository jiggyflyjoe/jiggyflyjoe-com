                <p class="about-info fade-in"><strong>jiggyflyjoe</strong>, or just <strong>Joe</strong>, is a tech-obsessed, introverted, diabetic, and “neurospicy” creative who swapped the city lights of Indianapolis for the quiet charm of rural Kansas—where the sunsets are gorgeous, but the internet speed is a humbling experience. A former Software Development and Visual Communications student turned coding and <strong>tech enthusiast</strong>, Joe spends his days deep-diving into software, web development, and gaming tech, always chasing that next great project.</p>
                <p class="about-info fade-in">When he's not wrangling code, Joe wears many hats—gamer, writer, live-streamer, podcaster, photographer, and graphic artist. His <strong>Twitch streams</strong> are a cozy, welcoming escape from the chaos of the world, fostering community and connection through good vibes and great games. But his most devoted audience? His feline trio: <strong>Tigger</strong>, <strong>Rufus</strong>, and <strong>Cinnamon</strong>, who ensure he never codes too long without a mandatory cuddle (or an impromptu keyboard takeover).</p>
                <p class="about-info fade-in">Looking ahead, Joe is focused on leveling up his skills, launching creative projects, and building toward a career that blends his love of <strong>tech, gaming, and storytelling</strong>. Whether he's crafting content, developing software, or just sharing a laugh online, his mission remains the same—bringing lights, creativity, and a sense of belonging to the digital world.</p>
